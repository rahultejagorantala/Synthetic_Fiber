# Establishing a Baseline for Cotton Fiber Classification
 
Problem: Establishing a Baseline for Cotton Fiber Classification Amidst Ambiguities in Ground Truth Labels.

Solution: Generating synthetic fiber images that closely resemble holographic cotton fiber images, granting us precise control over fiber structure and image fiber count. Subsequently, employing pre-trained models to classify these images, thereby gauging the upper limits of achievable performance.

This dataset of images are then used for supervised classification using pretrained models acheiving an accuracy of 99%.

 Rectangles and Cirlces with different textures as above are also created and also trained with pretrained models to check the accuracy.
